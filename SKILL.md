description: Framework for longform, source-backed industry research and publishable writing by AI agents. Use when an agent must plan, collect, verify, analyze, draft, review, revise, and finalize a substantial industry, market, company, product, technology, policy, or ecosystem research article/report across multiple stages and many sources. Prescribes task state, source/claim/uncertainty registries, depth budgeting, staged execution, optional analysis lenses, subagent review, reader-quality revision, and final prose cleanup. Do not use for quick factual answers, simple summaries, citation formatting only, spreadsheet-only work, or purely creative writing.

# Industry Research Framework

This skill is a framework for longform industry research and publishable writing. It ships no scraper, data source, or fixed report template; instead it prescribes conventions for how an AI agent persists state, separates evidence from prose, avoids topic drift, schedules review, and turns a large research backend into a clean reader-facing article or report.

## 1. Motivation

Longform research agents tend to fail in five recurring ways:

1. Topic overfitting: a method distilled from one project becomes falsely treated as the universal frame.
2. Process leakage: the final article reads like a work log, with phrases such as "the user provided" or "the material shows".
3. Evidence drift: sources, claims, uncertainty, and author judgment collapse into one undifferentiated argument.
4. False completion: a partial milestone is reported as final completion before coverage, review, and reader-quality revision are done.
5. Depth collapse: a report satisfies source counts and coverage checklists but is too short, compressed, or thin for the user's expected research depth.

Every mechanism in this framework targets one of those failures.

## 2. Behavioral Constraints

1. Deliverable first: if the requested output is an article or report, do not drift into system design, prompt design, or workflow exposition.
2. State before scale: for long tasks, write task state to files before expanding source collection.
3. Evidence is not prose: registries, logs, audit labels, and access failures stay backstage unless the user requests an audit appendix.
4. Depth budget before drafting: record expected depth, rough length band, unit-level expansion plan, and what "too short" would mean for this task.
5. Staged execution: plan, collect, analyze, draft, review, revise, and update state before moving to the next unit.
6. Section-level progress: write complex work by section, company, case, period, or argument; do not generate the whole report in one pass.
7. Optional lenses only: framing/category analysis, horizontal-vertical analysis, capital analysis, and adoption analysis are tools, not default structure.
8. Review closes the loop: every audit finding must become a revision action, a downgraded claim, or an explicit limitation.
9. Reader review comes last: improve readability only after factual, coverage, structure, and depth checks are stable.

## 3. Architecture

    Main Agent
    owns thesis, structure, final judgment

    Research Backend   Publishing Frontend
    state files        thesis / sections
    source registry    mechanisms / synthesis
    claim registry     counter-evidence
    uncertainty list   reader-facing references
    review logs        final prose cleanup

Subagents may inspect or challenge bounded parts of the backend, but the main agent owns the argument and final prose.

## 4. State Files

For substantial work, create:

    {task}/state/
      task_spec.md            # objective, reader, scope, evidence standard
      progress.json           # stage, completed units, open issues, stale_count
      findings.jsonl          # append-only findings and judgments
      directions_tried.json   # directions already attempted
      iteration_log.jsonl     # stage summaries

    {task}/logs/
      work.jsonl              # execution decisions
      review.jsonl            # review findings and routed fixes

    {task}/data/
      source_registry.csv
      claims_registry.csv
      uncertainty_registry.csv

Use state files to recover after context loss. Do not rely on chat history as the only memory.

## 5. Operating Loop

For each stage:

1. Plan the scope, inputs, output, and done criteria.
2. Collect or process only the sources needed for that stage.
3. Convert sources into claims, uncertainty, and analysis notes.
4. Draft a bounded section or unit.
5. Review the section for evidence, coverage, structure, skepticism, and prose.
6. Revise the section and registries.
7. Update progress and define the next stage.

If one cycle adds no new evidence, case, counterexample, framework, or judgment, increment `stale_count`. If `stale_count >= 2`, pivot the structural angle rather than merely searching harder.

For longform deliverables, do not use source count, claim count, link count, or file size as completion substitutes. They are backend health signals, not proof that the finished report has enough depth. Before final assembly, compare the draft against the depth budget and expand thin units before reader review.

## 6. Source And Claim Discipline

Classify sources by what they can prove:

- official materials show stated position, intent, product surface, or formal policy
- primary data supports measurable claims when definitions and collection methods are clear
- expert materials explain reasoning, context, and interpretation
- media materials show public framing but need corroboration for hard facts
- user/community evidence shows reception but is not automatically representative
- counter-evidence limits, weakens, or falsifies the main claim

Classify claims separately:

- verified fact
- source claim
- interpretation
- author judgment
- speculation

Every important hard claim should have a confidence boundary. Do not turn company PR, investor hopes, or media amplification into fact.

## 7. Analysis Lens Scheduling

Choose the lens that fits the research question:

- framing/category analysis: positioning, legitimacy, category creation, public meaning, and media translation
- horizontal-vertical analysis: timeline depth plus current competitor/substitute comparison
- adoption analysis: user behavior, workflow change, replacement, friction
- capital analysis: pricing, revenue, valuation, funding, cost structure, margins
- organization/talent analysis: operating model, hiring, leadership, talent flow
- policy/legitimacy analysis: regulation, compliance, trust, geopolitical or institutional pressure
- counter-case analysis: strongest alternative explanation and failure modes

Pick one primary lens and at most two secondary lenses unless the user explicitly requests a multi-method report.

Read `references/optional-analysis-lenses.md` when choosing lenses. Read `references/horizontal-vertical-analysis.md` only after that lens has been selected.

## 8. Subagent Scheduling

Use subagents only for bounded work:

- requirement mapping
- source discovery for separate regions, actors, or source classes
- evidence-chain verification
- coverage audit
- skeptical review
- structure review
- reader-quality review after the draft is stable

A subagent prompt must include objective, files or sections to inspect, output format, PASS/FAIL criteria, and boundaries. Subagents should not rewrite the whole report or own the thesis.

Read `references/subagents-and-review-loop.md` before delegation.

## 9. Finalization

The final article or report should contain reader-facing material only:

- conclusion-first insights when useful
- scope note
- analytical sections organized by argument, case, period, or mechanism
- synthesis across units
- counter-evidence and uncertainty expressed cleanly
- implications
- reader-facing reference appendix

Remove:

- visible source IDs
- audit labels
- file paths
- "the user provided"
- "the material shows"
- "this source supplements"
- "this section passed audit"
- excessive caveats that weaken rather than clarify judgment

## 10. Validation And Limits

Before declaring completion:

1. Required coverage is complete or limitations are explicit.
2. Major claims trace back to sources or uncertainty records.
3. Facts, source claims, interpretations, and author judgments remain distinct.
4. Counter-evidence has been addressed.
5. The draft meets the depth budget or explicitly explains why the original expected depth is no longer appropriate.
6. Reader review has been run after factual, coverage, structure, and depth review.
7. The final prose reads like an author's report, not an agent process report.

Limits:

1. The framework reduces citation and evidence errors; it does not eliminate them.
2. Subagent review is a check, not external truth.
3. Optional lenses can overfit the report if used mechanically.
4. State files help recovery, but they only work if updated during the task, not reconstructed after the fact.
