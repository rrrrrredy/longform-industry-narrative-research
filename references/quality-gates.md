# Quality Gates

Use these gates before declaring any stage or final deliverable complete.

## Before Collection

- Research brief gate has been run.
- Missing critical information has been asked in one compact batch.
- Expected length or depth has been confirmed, or a conservative assumption is recorded.
- Objective is explicit.
- Target reader is explicit.
- Final output type and language are explicit.
- Required coverage is listed.
- Out-of-scope claims are listed.
- Evidence standard is defined.
- Expected depth, rough length band, and unit-level expansion plan are defined.
- Initial structure is drafted.

## After Context Loss Or Restart

- `state/task_spec.md` has been read.
- `state/progress.json` has been read.
- Recent `findings.jsonl` and `iteration_log.jsonl` entries have been reviewed.
- `directions_tried.json` has been checked before repeating a direction.
- Completed stages are not re-run.
- The research brief is not re-asked if answers already exist in `task_spec.md`.

## Before Drafting

- Source categories are mapped to the research question.
- Important sources are logged.
- Access failures are recorded.
- Claims are separated from sources.
- Uncertainty is explicit.
- If source collection has produced no new relevant evidence for three consecutive passes, the direction is stopped or pivoted.
- If `source_registry.csv` is growing while `claims_registry.csv` stays thin, claim extraction happens before further collection.
- Analysis units are defined.
- The draft thesis is written in one sentence.
- The depth budget identifies which units need extended analysis and which can be brief.

## Every 20 Major Facts Or Judgments

- Update `source_registry.csv`.
- Update `claims_registry.csv`.
- Update `uncertainty_registry.csv` if needed.
- Check whether any claim depends on a weak or inaccessible source.
- Remove or downgrade claims that cannot be supported.

## Before Completing A Section

- The section has a local thesis.
- Evidence supports the thesis rather than merely filling space.
- Mechanisms are explained.
- Counter-evidence is handled where relevant.
- The section advances the whole argument.
- No internal source IDs or process language remain.

## Before Final Assembly

- Required units are covered.
- Important omissions are either fixed or disclosed.
- The draft meets the depth budget; if it does not, thin units are expanded before reader review.
- Source count, claim count, link count, and file size are not used as proof of completion.
- Repeated points are merged.
- The synthesis is more than a summary.
- Counter-evidence is integrated.
- The reference appendix is reader-facing.

## Reader Review Gate

Run this only after factual, coverage, and structure review.

Assess:

- readability
- cognitive load
- continuity
- friction points
- research-report quality

Reader review may revise ordering, transitions, paragraph density, titles, and wording. It must not invent facts or silently change evidence boundaries.

If reader review finds serious issues, revise and repeat. Cap reader-review cycles at three unless the user asks for more.

Full review-revise cycles for a single section are capped at two unless the user asks for more; unresolved issues become limitations or follow-up actions.

## Before Public Delivery

- The first page makes the main argument clear.
- The report length and depth match the user's expectation for the assignment.
- The final prose reads as the author's work, not an agent log.
- Facts, source claims, interpretations, and judgments are not blurred.
- Major judgments are traceable backstage.
- No visible audit labels, file paths, or source IDs remain in the body.
- Remaining limitations are stated cleanly when they matter.
- A completion note exists if the user needs one.
